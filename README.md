# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts  

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
   1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner 
   1. And this will be done programatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
   1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
   2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger 

## Notic

The chainLInk VRF version used in this code is an outdated version 2.0, and we will learn version 2.5 and refine the content in the future
